Welcome!
Hello and welcome to my website.

My name is Clinta Puthussery Varghese.
I am currently pursuing my second semester as a graduate student in Statistics at [Zicklin School of Business](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/) in the Baruch College, City University Of New York with an anticipated graduation in May 2026.

My aspiration is to become a Data Scientist. As beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder, so too does the power of data rest in the hands of the analyst. I am dedicated to equipping myself to work with messy data, uncover insights, and ultimately contribute to making the world a better place.
Poke around my website to learn more.
